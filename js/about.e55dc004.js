I began to work with the HTC Vive, and built some awesome things. I did a research project under one of my professors in which we used the Vive and Leap Motion in order to allow a user to ‘feel’ a spider crawling on their arm. We used the haptic feedback from a tens unit (an electrotherapy device) to stimulate the users arm so it felt like a spider was walking on it. Along with that project, I became involved in the Virtual Reality club, and became the Historian for my sophomore year. During the past summer, I worked for three different VR companies. The first, VR Medical Center, has been around for 20 years and is building experiences to help people fight their phobias in VR. The next one is Nanome, which is a Nanoparticle simulation experience. The third is a stealth mode startup which is working with smell-based VR.")])])}],n={components:{},data:function(){return{}}},r=n,s=(a("e76e"),a("2877")),h=Object(s["a"])(r,o,i,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=h.exports}}]);
